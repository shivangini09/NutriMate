# NutriMate 🥗🤖
*AI-powered Personalized Nutrition Recommendation System*

## 📌 Introduction
NutriMate is a machine learning–based personalized nutritionist that recommends diet plans tailored to an individual’s health profile, fitness goals, and dietary preferences.  
The aim of this project is to make nutrition advice **accessible, affordable, and data-driven**, especially for people who cannot consult professional dietitians.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Build a **user profiling system** using health indicators (age, weight, activity level, health conditions, goals).  
- Develop a **diet recommendation engine** using nutritional datasets.  
- Ensure transparency with **explainable AI** (why certain foods are recommended).  
- Deploy the system as a simple **web application** for accessibility.  

## 🗂️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, SHAP  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Deployment:** Flask/FastAPI + React / Streamlit  

## 📊 Datasets
- [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) – official database of foods & nutrition.  
- [Indian Food Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/indian-food-101) – regional Indian dishes with ingredients.  
- [Nutrition Facts Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/nutrition-facts).  

## 🏗️ Roadmap
- [ ] Data collection & preprocessing  
- [ ] Exploratory data analysis  
- [ ] User profiling system (BMR, TDEE calculations)  
- [ ] Rule-based diet recommender (MVP)  
- [ ] ML-based recommendation system (clustering, content-based filtering)  
- [ ] Explainability (SHAP values, feature importance)  
- [ ] Deployment (Flask/Streamlit + simple frontend)  

## 📌 Status
🚧 Project initialization – setting up repo & preparing datasets. Updates coming soon! 🚀
